    <string name="news">Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi has been mandated to reach out to other leaders to create the National Super Alliance (NASA) or Muungano Maalum.

Party secretary general Godfrey Osotsi said they will work with like-minded leaders "against misrule by Jubilee".

Osotsi added that the ruling coalition is "characterised by condoning rampant corruption, a ruinous and extravagant economic model of borrowing, arrogant ethnic exclusionism and ruining our youth with the hustler mentality".

"We have mandated the party leader to enhance NASA by setting up the ANC Technical Team of Experts to explore Muungano Maalum with other Kenyan patriots," he said.

He spoke on Thursday during the a meeting of Amani\'s National Elections Committee and Parliamentary Group in Machakos.

Mudavadi has been in talks with Cord leader Raila Odinga for the formation of a super alliance to defeat President Uhuru Kenyatta\'s Jubilee Party in the next election.
